## Important notice for existing users

If you previously bought the add-on, the following information is very important. There are a few steps you need to follow when moving to the new version.

* Deactivate and delete the previous plugin completely.
* Then install the new version. Either:Search for the plugin, "LSX PayFast Gateway for Give", via the plugins screen inside your WordPress dashboard
* Or download the plugin from WordPress.org and upload it via your plugins screen

Unfortunately you may need to reconfigure payments via PayFast in Give. The plugin changed in a way that could not avoid this.
